# web Scrapping Project - CodingBar

This project is a web scraper for the [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com) website, designed to extract programming problems and related examples. It uses popular Python libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `fake_useragent`.

## Files

- `scraper.py`: This is the Python script that I wrote to perform the web scraping.

## Requirements

Before running the script, you need to install a few Python libraries. You can do this by running:

pip install requests fake-useragent beautifulsoup4 lxml

## Features

- Fetches links to all exercise categories on CodingBat.
- Iterates through exercises in each category to extract:
  - Problem statements.
  - Associated examples.
- Prints the extracted data to the console.

## Disclaimer

This excercise is part of the course "Web Scraping and Crawling with Python: Beautiful Soup, Requests & Selenium" from Waqar Ahmed (GoTrained Academy) on UDEMY
